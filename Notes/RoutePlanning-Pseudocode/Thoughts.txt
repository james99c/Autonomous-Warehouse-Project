Using time stamps. If 2 robots will be at the same point at the same
time, re-route
  1. one of them randomly?
  2. Re-route before executing the route at the beginning or during the
     execution (when the next move will collide with other robots)?

Time taken to turn vs Time taken not to turn (go straight) is different.
(It takes a bit more time to rotate) After a few movements, the time 
stamps will no longer be synchronised.
  1. Give a buffer time after like 5 movements? Where all robots stop
     executing movements and wait for a few seconds
  2. Communicate with the server after every move? In order to retrieve
     a new route
